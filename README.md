# wanderquest
WanderQuest entails developing a traveler game quest application for Android users. The goal is to offer users an engaging journey through various destinations. By using advanced technologies that Google has to offer such as the Google Maps API, WanderQuest enables adventurers to mark visited locations and unlock new destinations created just for the traveler (user) using route optimization. Encouraging exploration and accomplishments is the goal for all travelers. This project aspires to redefine travel experiences for users to embark on exciting quests and create great memories. 


Backend Integration:
Integrated the Google Places API to fetch restaurant data based on user queries (e.g., "restaurants in New York").
Data Handling:
Designed data classes using Kotlinx. serialization to parse and manage destination details received from the API response.
Route Optimization:
Developed a route optimization utility using algorithmic concepts like the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) to create an optimized sequence for visiting destinations based on user preferences and location.
Though initial UI and API implementation was planned, due to time constraints, the full integration of the user interface showcasing destination details obtained from the Google Places API was not achieved. However, the groundwork was laid using views and XML layouts, setting the foundation for a visually engaging interface that aims to display an array of travel options for users exploring New York City."
